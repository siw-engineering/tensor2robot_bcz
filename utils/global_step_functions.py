  """Piecewise linear function assuming given values at given boundaries.

  Args:
    boundaries: A list of `Tensor`s or `int`s or `float`s with strictly
      increasing entries. The first entry must be 0.
    values: A list of `Tensor`s or float`s or `int`s that specifies the values
      at the `boundaries`. It must have the same number of elements as
      `boundaries`, and all elements should have the same type.
    name: A string. Optional name of the operation. Defaults to
      'PiecewiseConstant'.

  Returns:
    A 0-D Tensor. Its value is `values[0]` if `x < boundaries[0]` and
    `values[-1]` if `x >= boundaries[-1]. If `boundaries[i] <= x <
