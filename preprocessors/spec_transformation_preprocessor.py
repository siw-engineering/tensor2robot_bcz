  """A convenience abstract preprocessor which allows to replace tensors.

  It is a common requirement for preprocessors to e.g. convert data types
  for images from tf.float32 to tf.uint8. For instance, models should only
  operate on tpu ready tensor types such as [tf.float32, tf.int32, tf.int64,
  tf.bfloat16,tf.string, and tf.bool]. However, images are typically stored in
  tf.uint8 format. Another common operation is changing the shape of the
  feature, for example, due to cropping. Many specs specified in models do not
  require any modification, therefore, the preprocessor simply has to request
  them and not alter them.

  This abstract preprocessor allows to perform these transformations very easily
  by merely updating the existing specs provided by the model. It reduces the
  requirement for boilerplate code to implement default model specific
  preprocessors. However, we encourage the implementation of "full"
  preprocessors for new model which specify the in as well as the out
  specifications completely in the preprocessor.
